# ECE375
Labs from ECE 375 (CpArch) programmed in VHDL

A computer hardware design course teaches the fundamentals of digital system design, focusing on how computers and related hardware are built at the circuit and architectural level. In such a course, students learn how to describe, simulate, and implement digital circuits using hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL.

    VHDL and Verilog are two popular HDLs used to model digital systems such as processors, memory units, and controllers.
    Students write code to describe the behavior and structure of hardware components (e.g., adders, multiplexers, finite state machines).
    The course includes simulation, synthesis, and sometimes implementation of designs on FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays).
    Topics often covered: combinational and sequential logic, datapath and control design, memory systems, input/output, and CPU architecture.
    The goal is to prepare students to design, verify, and implement digital systems used in modern computers and embedded devices.
